1) Differnece between Mutex and semaphores
	- Mutexes are very useful to protect data (critical section) from race conditions. Semaphores are usually used to synchronize threads more than to protect critical section.
	-  The reason for that is that semaphores do not have any ownership. A mutex can be released only by the thread that acquired it (a thread gets ownership of a mutex when waking from a mutex wait). 		However for semaphores any thread (or main) can initialize them to locked (0), and any thread can wait on them (blocks on 0 and decrements its value after) or post to them (increments its value)
